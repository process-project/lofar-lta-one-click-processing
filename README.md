# LOFAR LTA one click processing
Build and run the Docker image to set up a web service for one click processing of observations from the LOFAR LTA.
Not intended as production level code for PROCESS, but it shows the kind of interface we want for Use  Case 2.
So this web service is intended for demonstration purposes.

Clone the repository and make sure your Docker daemon is running.
